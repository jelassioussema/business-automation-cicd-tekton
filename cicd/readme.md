# CICD Demo Provisioning and testing

## Pre-requisites

* OpenShift 4.6+ (with admin access to install operators)
* Git client on your local machine ( download at https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* GitHub account ( http://github.com/) 
* OpenShift oc client ([Where to download oc client](https://developers.redhat.com/openshift/command-line-tools))

## Demo Provisioning

### Preparing the environment

1. Log in to your OpenShift cluster in your terminal. You can copy the login command by using the option below in your OpenShift web UI.
	![Log in to OpenShift using CLI](docs/ocp-login.png)
2. Create an Openshift Project
   `oc new-project rhpam-sandbox`
3. Install OpenShift Pipelines Operator in your Cluster. 
   1. To install it, using the **Administrator View**, navigate to **Operators** -> **Operator** Hub menu. 
   2. In the text field, search for OpenShift Pipelines, select the Operator that will show up. 
       ![Installing OpenShift Pipelines](docs/tekton-operator-install.png)
   3. Click **Install**. On the next screen you can use the default values, and click on **Install** again.
4. While the operator is installing, fork and clone this repo to your local machine. Access the folder directory so we can start deploying the pipeline definitions.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/${yourgithubuser}/my-business-automation-showcase.git
$ cd my-business-automation-showcase
```

### Creating the Tekton resources into your project namespace

1. Run the following oc command to create the pipeline resources:

```
$ oc create -f ./cicd/tekton-resources/ -n rhpam-sandbox

configmap/custom-maven-settings created
eventlistener.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-event-listener created
persistentvolumeclaim/maven-repo-pvc created
task.tekton.dev/mvn-jkube created
task.tekton.dev/mvn created
pipeline.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-pipeline created
persistentvolumeclaim/source-workspace-pvc created
triggerbinding.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-trigger-binding created
triggertemplate.triggers.tekton.dev/ba-cicd-trigger-template created	
```

The following resources should be created in your namespace:

* PVCs for maven and git repos
	* maven-repo-pvc
	* shared-workspace
* ConfigMap with a custom Maven settings.xml
* Tekton Resources
	* Event Listener
		> provides an addressable endpoint (the event sink). Trigger is referenced inside the EventListener Spec. It uses the extracted event parameters from each TriggerBinding (and any supplied static parameters) to create the resources specified in the corresponding TriggerTemplate. It also optionally allows an external service to pre-process the event payload via the interceptor field.

	* Triggers
		> in conjunction with pipelines enable us to hook our Pipelines to respond to external github events (push events, pull requests etc). It combines TriggerTemplate, TriggerBindings and interceptors.

	* TriggerTemplate
		> Templates resources to be created (e.g. Create PipelineResources and PipelineRun that uses them).

	* TriggerBinding
		> validates events and extracts payload fields

	* Tasks
		> a collection of Steps that you define and arrange in a specific order of execution as part of your continuous integration flow. A Task executes as a Pod on your Kubernetes cluster.

	* Pipeline
		> a collection of Tasks that you define and arrange in a specific order of execution as part of your continuous integration flow. Each Task in a Pipeline executes as a Pod on your Kubernetes cluster. You can configure various execution conditions to fit your business needs.

You can confirm this by opening the OpenShift Console using the Developer perspective, and accessing Pipelines menu. From the **Project** dropdown list, select `rhpam-sandbox`, then you should see the `ba-cicd-pipeline`:
![Pipeline View	](docs/pipelines-view.png)

Click the `ba-cicd-pipeline` to see its details with a graphical representation.
![Pipeline View](docs/pipeline-details.png)

### Creating the webhook to trigger pipelines automatically

1. Expose the `Pipeline Event Listener`. In order to trigger a *Pipeline Run* with a *Git Push event* you need to expose your `Pipeline EventListener`:

```
$ oc expose svc el-ba-cicd-event-listener -n rhpam-sandbox
route.route.openshift.io/el-ba-cicd-event-listener exposed	
```

2. Open the Topology view in the Developer Dashboard to see the Trigger Event Listener POD

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/pipeline-trigger-event-listener.png">
</p>


This is the service that listens to your git hook events (via webhooks)!

3. Get your EventListener URL using the following command:

```
$ echo "$(oc  get route el-ba-cicd-event-listener --template='http://{{.spec.host}}')"
http://el-ba-cicd-event-listener-rhpam-sandbox.your.cluster.domain.com
```

#### Configuring GitHub Webhooks 
1. Open the your project's **Settings** in GitHub and access the **Webhooks** menu.
2. Click on the **Add Webhook** button and enter your password if requested.
   * Set the **Payload URL** with the **Pipeline EventListener** URL copied previously. 
   * Set the **Content type** as `application/json`
   * Once finished, click on the green button **Add Webhook**.

## Testing your environment

### Trigger the Pipeline execution

Let's do some changes on the project and push it to the git repository to see the pipeline in action. You can use VSCode and the Business Automation extension to support these next steps.

1. Open your decision service project in VSCode:
   `$ code decisions-showcase/`
3. Open a decision asset and change one of the values. For example, you can open the `Loan Approval.dmn` or the  `rulebase.drl` file under the resources folder, and update one of the rules' or decision's values. Save the file.
4. Adjust any unit tests accordingly to the changes below.
5. Back to the terminal (or using VScode Git extension), commit and push.

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -am "applying some changes"
$ git push origin master
```

5. Open GitHub UI, and in the project's **Settings**, under the **Webhooks** menu, you can confirm the **git push webhook** previously configured for your repo is activated. Click on your webhook and scroll down to see the recent deliveries. 
   ![Git Webhook activated](docs/github-webhook-payload.png)

6. In OpenShift, you can confirm that consequently a new **Pipeline Run** was be triggered as well.
   ![Pipeline Event triggered](docs/pipeline-run-status.png)

7. Using the Administrator Perspective, you can access **Pipelines** -> **Pipelines** ->**ba-cicd-pipeline**  ->  **Pipeline Runs** tab to see your Pipeline executions
   ![Pipeline Runs](docs/pipeline-run-status-2.png)

8. Click on the active execution to follow the run status:
	![Pipeline Event triggered](docs/pipeline-status-3.png)

9. Click on the `Logs` tab to see the output of each individual task execution
	![Pipeline task logs](docs/pipeline-run-task-logs.png)



## Accessing the Business Application Service

At the end of the Pipeline execution you should have two instances of your Kie Server running on Spring Boot containers.
![Kie Server SB POD](docs/kie-server-pods-topology.png)

1. Click on the POD edge arrow to open the public App Route URL

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/kie-server-pod.png">
</p>

You should see the sample Business Application Service home page
![Kie Server home page](docs/business-service-app.png)

exposing the standard Kie Server API *(user: wbadmin, passwd: wbadmin)*
![Kie Server API](docs/kie-server-swagger.png)

## Build a custom Tekton Maven Task image
To be able to use JKube Maven Plugin I extended the standard Tekton Maven image to include the `oc` CLI tool.

```
docker build -f docker/mvn-with-oc-task.dockerfile \ 
--no-cache \ 
--build-arg OC_PKG_URL="https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/oc/latest/linux/oc.tar.gz" \
-t quay.io/rafaeltuelho/mvn-kube-oc:openjdk-11 .
```

> NOTE: this image is publicly available in my Quay.io repo: https://quay.io/repository/rafaeltuelho/mvn-kube-oc
> No need to do anything here.

## Clean up your namespace
To delete the application provisioned y the Pipeline Run, execute the following command.

```
oc delete all -l provider=jkube -n <namespace>

pod "business-application-service-1-9nl6j" deleted
pod "business-application-service-1-tnqth" deleted
replicationcontroller "business-application-service-1" deleted
service "business-application-service" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
buildconfig.build.openshift.io "business-application-service-s2i" deleted
build.build.openshift.io "business-application-service-s2i-1" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "business-application-service" deleted
```
